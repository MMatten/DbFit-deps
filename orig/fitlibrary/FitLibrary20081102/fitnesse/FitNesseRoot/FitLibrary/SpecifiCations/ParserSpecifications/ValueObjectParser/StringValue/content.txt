For a ''value object'' to be represented as a String, it needs either:
 * A ''public static Object parse(String)'' method in the class; and/or
 * A ''delegate parser'' that will handle parsing a String into an object of the ''value object'' class
  * A ''delegate parser'' is needed if the value object belong to a class that you can't change. Eg, if you're using a provided ''Date'' or ''Point'', etc

^SelfParseString, where a ''value object'' class has a ''parse()'' method
^DelegateParseString, where a delegate parses for a specific ''value object'' class
