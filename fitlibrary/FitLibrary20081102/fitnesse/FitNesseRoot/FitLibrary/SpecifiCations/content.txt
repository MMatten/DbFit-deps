 * Here we specify ${fitLibrary} by example, using ${fitLibrary} tables
 * The following assumes considerable familiarity with the ideas of ${fitLibrary}
 * This is '''not''' intended as a tutorial. See .FitLibrary.UserGuide for that.

|^ReadingSpecifications|''The format of the storytests/specifications''|

||!3 ''Storytests for specifying:''|
|^DomainWorkflow|''As with ^DoWorkflow, but with support for three phases of ${workflow}'': ${setup}, ${actions} and ${checks}|
|^DoWorkflow|''A sequence of actions on a system, starting in some state (!-DoFixture-!)''|
|^CollectionSpecifications|''Various collections of elements, such as lists, sets, maps, arrays, etc (both checking and setup)''|
|^BusinessRules|''Calculation rules, constraints, and combinations''|
|^DomainObject|''The property values of ${domainObject}s (both checking and setup)''|
|^DomainAggregate|''The aggregate structure of ${domainObject}s''|
|^SpecialisedTables|''Grids of values, images, HTML lists, file comparisons, etc''|

|^SuiteFixture|''How the same suite of storytests can be used to test a system in very different ways''|
|^DynamicVariables|''How variables can be used in storytests at runtime''|
|^DefinedActions|''Parameterised actions can be defined within storytests''|
|>SelectFixture|''Switches between several named do fixtures''|
|^GoingIntoFlow|''Using !-FitLibraryServer-!, it's no longer necessary for the first table to have a !-DoFixture-! table in order to be in flow''|

|^ParserSpecifications|''How values are parsed from strings and embedded tables''|
|^TechnicalSpecifications|''Detailed specifications that are more likely to be of interest to those who port ${fitLibrary} to other languages''|
|^JavaSpecific|''Details that are specific to Java and may not be implemented in other languages''|
|^AlienEvaluator|''How ${fitLibrary} inter-operates with ${fit}''|
|^ExperiMental|''Some experimental features that may well be dropped''|
