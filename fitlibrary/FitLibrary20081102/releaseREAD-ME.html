<h1><i>FitLibrary For FitNesse</i></h1>

This contains the latest release of the <i>FitLibrary</i> for <i>FitNesse</i> users. 

<p/>This release of FitLibrary only works completely on <i>FitNesse20080812</i>. Some parts will not work with earlier versions of FitNesse.

<p/>I was unable to get all of this working correctly when I ran off port 80 or 8080. However, it works fine on port 8980. The supplied <i>run.bat</i> file has this as the port number.

<p/>The FolderRunner parts of FitLibrary have not been tested with this version.

<p/>In the following, it's assumed that you are already familiar with <i>FitNesse</i>.

<h3>Supplied <i>FitLibrary</i> files</h3>

The <i>fitnesse</i> directory within the <i>FitLibrary</i> release contains the following files and subdirectories:

<br/>

<h3>Updating <i>FitLibraryForFitNesse</i> in your existing <i>FitNesse</i> system</h3>

If you want to keep any changes you've made to the pages in the user guide, or associated example code, you may like to save them first.
<br/><br/>On Windows, to update just the <i>FitLibrary</i> release:<br/>

<ul>

	<li>Ensure you have a backup copy of your existing <i>FitNesse</i> system first.</li>
	<li>Drop the folder <i>fitnesse</i> inside this <i>FitLibrary</i> release onto the folder <i>fitnesse</i> of your existing <i>FitNesse</i> system.</li>

	<li>A <i>Confirm Folder Replace</i> dialog will appear: "This folder already contains a folder named 'fitnesse'. If the files in the existing folder have the same name as files in the folder you are moving or copying, they will be replaced. Do you still want to move or copy the folder?"</li>
	<li>If you're happy to replace the <i>FitLibrary</i> files concerned, click <i>Yes to All</i>. This will not change or remove any other files/pages.</li>
	<li>If not, click <i>No</i>.</li>

</ul>
